## ðŸŒ³ Git Branching & Workflow
ðŸ”¹ Creating branch from JIRA
1. Go to the JIRA issue you're working on
2. Click on "Create branch" in Jira (on the issue page)
3. Go to the terminal and run: `git fetch`
4. Switch to the newly created branch: `git checkout ES-21-Create-README`

This automatically links your branch, commits and PRs to the JIRA issue.

ðŸ”¹ Creating a branch manually
If creating manually, always branch from main:
````
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b <issue-key>-<short-description>
````

Example: `git checkout -b ES-21-Create-README`

Include the Jira issue key (e.g., ES-21) to automatically link your branch to the issue. This helps track progress, commits, and PRs directly in Jira.


## ðŸ”„ Committing Changes (Conventional Commits)

### Use Conventional Commit messages for consistency:

Format: ```git commit -m "<type>(optional scope): <description>"```

Examples:
```
git commit -m "feat(guest): add temporary guest parking feature"

git commit -m "docs(readme): update local setup instructions"
```

### Commit Types:
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Style-related changes
